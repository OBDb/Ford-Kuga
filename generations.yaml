    description: "The original Ford Kuga was a compact crossover SUV designed primarily for the European market. Built on Ford's C1 platform shared with the Focus and C-MAX, it featured sporty styling that helped differentiate it from more utilitarian competitors. Initially available with a 2.0L Duratorq diesel engine and later a 2.5L Duratec petrol, most models featured an intelligent all-wheel-drive system that could transfer torque between front and rear axles as needed. The interior offered a driver-focused cockpit with higher quality materials than many competitors. The Kuga emphasized on-road handling and driving dynamics over serious off-road capability, establishing it as one of the more enjoyable-to-drive vehicles in its segment. This generation was not sold in North America, where the similar but not identical Escape continued as Ford's compact SUV offering."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The second-generation Kuga became a global model as part of Ford's 'One Ford' strategy, sold as the Escape in North America. Built on Ford's Global C platform, it featured more modern styling with improved aerodynamics and a more upscale appearance. Engine options varied by market but typically included EcoBoost petrol engines and Duratorq diesels with improved efficiency. Available technology expanded significantly to include SYNC with MyFord Touch (later SYNC 3), active park assist, and advanced safety features. This generation introduced the hands-free power liftgate activated by a foot motion under the rear bumper. Interior space improved with more room for passengers and cargo, while maintaining good driving dynamics. A significant facelift in 2016 updated the styling and technology offerings. As a global model, this generation successfully balanced the needs of different markets while maintaining the Kuga's reputation for driving enjoyment in the increasingly competitive compact SUV segment."

    end_year: null
    description: "The current Kuga (continuing as Escape in North America) features a complete redesign with more car-like styling cues and significantly improved aerodynamics. Built on Ford's C2 platform shared with the Focus, it emphasizes improved driving dynamics and efficiency. Engine options vary by market but include EcoBoost petrol engines, EcoBlue diesels, and for the first time, hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. The PHEV variant offers approximately 31 miles of electric-only range from its 14.4 kWh battery. The interior represents a major step forward with improved materials, a digital instrument cluster, and an 8-inch touchscreen running SYNC 4. Available driver assistance technology expanded to include Ford Co-Pilot360 with features like adaptive cruise control with lane centering. Despite its more car-like appearance, cargo space and practicality have improved over the previous generation. This generation balances efficiency, technology, and driving dynamics while offering multiple electrification options to meet increasingly strict emissions regulations."
